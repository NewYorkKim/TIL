## Why learn about the cloud?

- Demand for cloud computing skills is increasing
- Cloud computing skills are relevant for all IT professionals
- Cloud certification validates knowledge and skills



## Why cloud computing?

- IT assets as programmatic resources to quickly set up and tear down resources
- Access resources dynamically for __agility__ and __flexibility__ to meet customer needs
- Pay-as-you-go to test and use the system without being fully committed



## Definition of cloud computing

Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.

- __On-demand delivery__: A cloud provider has the resources you need, when you need them

- __IT resources over the internet__: Servers, networks, storage, development tools, and applications

- __Pay-as-you-go__: Pay only for what you need when you use it



## Six benefits of cloud computing

1. Trade upfront expense for variable expense
2. Stop spending money to run and maintain data centers
3. Stop guessing capacity
4. Benefit from massive economies of scale
5. Increase speed and agility
6. Go global in minutes



## Deploying to the cloud

Cloud service and deployment methods provide different levels of control, flexibility, and management.

Deployment models include

- Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
- Platform as a service (PaaS)
- Software as a service (SaaS)

Deployment strategies include

- Cloud
- Hybrid
- On-premises

Each type of deployment model and strategy has a shared responsibility between you and the cloud service provider.



##### Infrastructure as a service

- Contains the basic building blocks for cloud IT
- Provides access to networking features, computers (virtual or on dedicated hardware), and data storage space
- Provides the highest level of flexibility and management control over your IT resources
- EC2, S3, RDS, and Route 53



##### Platform as a service

- Removes the need for organizations to manage the underlying infrastructure (usually hardware and operating systems)
- They can focus on the deployment and management of applications
- These tools give developers the ability to be more efficient because they don't need to worry about resource procurement, capacity planning, software maintenance, and patching
- Elastic Beanstalk



##### Software as a service

- A completed software product that the service provider runs and manages
- With a SaaS offering, you do not have to think about how the service is maintained or how the underlying infrastructure is managed
- You only must think about how you will use that particular piece of software
- video meeting sites, email sites, file sharing sites, and messaging apps



##### Cloud

- In a cloud-based deployment model, you can migrate existing applications to the cloud, or you can design and build new applications in the cloud
- You can build those applications on low-level infrastructure that requires your IT staff to manage them
- You can build them by using higher-level services that reduce the management, architecting, and scaling requirements of the core infrastructure



##### Hybrid

- In a hybrid deployment, cloud-based resources are connected to on-premises infrastructure
- You can integrate cloud-based resources with legacy IT applications



##### On-premises

- Also known as a private cloud deployment
- In this model, resources are deployed on premises by using virtualization and resource management tools
- Increase resource utilization by using application management and virtualization technologies
