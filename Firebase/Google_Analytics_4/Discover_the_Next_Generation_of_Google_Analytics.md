## Discover What's New with Google Analytics

- Google Analytics 4 properties were briefly known as __"App + Web properties"__
- In the past, there were only two kinds of properties:
  - Universal Analytics for measuring mobile app activity
  - Google Analytics for Firebase for measuring mobile app activity



##### The benefits of Google Analytics 4 properties

- Scales with your business
- Adapts to a changing environment
- Reveals intelligent business insights
- Helps you achieve your marketing goals



##### Integrated reporting

- Full reporting across devices
  - Analytics can measure a single user journey across devices based on the best available user identifiers
- Unified web and app reporting
- Integrated reporting and analysis

##### Some more key differences

- Audiences
  - A set of users you define based on different attributes that are important to your business
- Advanced features available to all Analytics accounts
  - Explorations
  - BigQuery Export



##### How Google Analytics 4 properties collect and process data

- Rather than using a session-based model, which groups user interactions within a given time frame, it uses an __event-based model__, which processes each user interaction as a standalone event

- When you only have access to one identity space, like device ID, a single person could appear as a different user every time they interact with your business on a different device
- But when you use multiple identity spaces, you can get better insight into user journeys, with more robust cross-device and cross-platform data and reporting that reflects de-duplicated users

- With GA4 properties, you can answer questions like:
  - How many total unique users do you have, no matter what platforms they use?
  - How many conversations have occurred on your app and website in the last week -- and which platform is contributing to most of these conversations?
